//all of the book objects are going to be stored in an array so add a function 
//to the script (not the constructor) that can take the users input and store the 
//new book object into an array.

//write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page.
//You can display them in some sort of table, or each on their own 'card'. It 
//might help for now to manually add a few books to your array so you can see
//the display

//add a NEW BOOK button that brings up a form allowing the users to input the details
//for the new book: author, title, # of pages, wheather its been read.

//add a button on each books display to remove the book from the library
    //you need to associate your DOM elements witht the actual book objects. 
    //One easy solution is giving the a data-attribute that corresponds to the 
    //index of the library array

//add a button on each books display to change its read status
    //to facilitate this you will want to create the function that toggles
    //a books read status on your Book prototpe instance
